            Up next is the King that loves flying with his private jet. If you guessed <i><strong>Netherlands </strong></i>, you are correct. The now Princess Beatrix,
            abdicated in favour of her son, King Willem Alexander. He has a wife, Queen Maxima with which he has three daughters, one of whom is the heir to the throne.

                King's name is King Carl XVI Gustav, he is 77 years old (Birth in 1946). He is married to Queen Silvia. They have three children: Victoria, Carl Philip and Madeline. All of their children are married and have children.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here is one interesting fact about Victoria and Carl Philip. So now Victoria is Crown Princess and Carl Philip is only Prince. But when Prince Carl Philip was born he was named Crown Prince (Because the first male in the family should inherit the throne), but there came new rules. So at the age of 13, Victoria was once again heir to the throne.
            </p>
            <div id="Victoria">
              <div>
                  Because, here, mostly, I am showing one outfit of each Queen/future Queen. Here, I will show one of Crown Princess Victoria.
              </div>

                    her last cycled dress is for the wedding of Crown Prince of Jordan and his now wife. So that's why I will show this outfit

                   Mette-Marit has a style which we are not seeing often because Norway royals are working outside the royal household.
                   I will show her wedding outfit, because she looked like a fairytale Princess there.
